<p>Field Middleware lets you run arbitrary code <strong>before or after</strong> a field is resolved. A field middleware can be used to convert the result of a field, validate the arguments of a field, or even check field-level roles (for example, required to access a target field for which a middleware function is executed).</p>
<p>You can connect multiple middleware functions to a field. In this case, they will be called sequentially along the chain where the previous middleware decides to call the next one. The order of the middleware functions in the <code>middleware</code> array is important. The first resolver is the &quot;most-outer&quot; layer, so it gets executed first and last (similarly to the <code>graphql-middleware</code> package). The second resolver is the &quot;second-outer&quot; layer, so it gets executed second and second to last.</p>
<h4 appAnchor id="getting-started"><span>Getting started</span></h4>
<p>Let&#39;s start off by creating a simple middleware that will log a field value before it&#39;s sent back to the client:</p>
<pre><code class="language-typescript">
import &#123; FieldMiddleware, MiddlewareContext, NextFn &#125; from &#39;@nestjs/graphql&#39;;

const loggerMiddleware: FieldMiddleware = async (
  ctx: MiddlewareContext,
  next: NextFn,
) =&gt; &#123;
  const value = await next();
  console.log(value);
  return value;
&#125;;
</code></pre>
<blockquote class="
info "><strong>Hint</strong> The <code>MiddlewareContext</code> is an object that consist of the same arguments that are normally received by the GraphQL resolver function (<code>{{ &#39;{&#39; }} source, args, context, info {{ &#39;}&#39; }}</code>), while <code>NextFn</code> is a function that let you execute the next middleware in the stack (bound to this field) or the actual field resolver.
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="
warning "><strong>Warning</strong> Field middleware functions cannot inject dependencies nor access Nest&#39;s DI container as they are designed to be very lightweight and shouldn&#39;t perform any potentially time-consuming operations (like retrieving data from the database). If you need to call external services/query data from the data source, you should do it in a guard/interceptor bounded to a root query/mutation handler and assign it to <code>context</code> object which you can access from within the field middleware (specifically, from the <code>MiddlewareContext</code> object).
</blockquote>
<p>Note that field middleware must match the <code>FieldMiddleware</code> interface. In the example above, we first run the <code>next()</code> function (which executes the actual field resolver and returns a field value) and then, we log this value to our terminal. Also, the value returned from the middleware function completely overrides the previous value and since we don&#39;t want to perform any changes, we simply return the original value.</p>
<p>With this in place, we can register our middleware directly in the <code>@Field()</code> decorator, as follows:</p>
<pre><code class="language-typescript">
@ObjectType()
export class Recipe &#123;
  @Field(&#123; middleware: [loggerMiddleware] &#125;)
  title: string;
&#125;
</code></pre>
<p>Now whenever we request the <code>title</code> field of <code>Recipe</code> object type, the original field&#39;s value will be logged to the console.</p>
<blockquote class="

</blockquote>
<blockquote class="
warning "><strong>Warning</strong> Field middleware can be applied only to <code>ObjectType</code> classes. For more details, check out this <a rel='nofollow' target='_blank' href="https://github.com/nestjs/graphql/issues/2446">issue</a>.
</blockquote>
<p>Also, as mentioned above, we can control the field&#39;s value from within the middleware function. For demonstration purposes, let&#39;s capitalise a recipe&#39;s title (if present):</p>
<pre><code class="language-typescript">
const value = await next();
return value?.toUpperCase();
</code></pre>
<p>In this case, every title will be automatically uppercased, when requested.</p>
<p>Likewise, you can bind a field middleware to a custom field resolver (a method annotated with the <code>@ResolveField()</code> decorator), as follows:</p>
<pre><code class="language-typescript">
@ResolveField(() =&gt; String, &#123; middleware: [loggerMiddleware] &#125;)
title() &#123;
  return &#39;Placeholder&#39;;
&#125;
</code></pre>
<blockquote class="
warning "><strong>Warning</strong> In case enhancers are enabled at the field resolver level (<a href="/graphql/other-features#execute-enhancers-at-the-field-resolver-level">read more</a>), field middleware functions will run before any interceptors, guards, etc., <strong>bounded to the method</strong> (but after the root-level enhancers registered for query or mutation handlers).
</blockquote>
<h4 appAnchor id="global-field-middleware"><span>Global field middleware</span></h4>
<p>In addition to binding a middleware directly to a specific field, you can also register one or multiple middleware functions globally. In this case, they will be automatically connected to all fields of your object types.</p>
<pre><code class="language-typescript">
GraphQLModule.forRoot(&#123;
  autoSchemaFile: &#39;schema.gql&#39;,
  buildSchemaOptions: &#123;
    fieldMiddleware: [loggerMiddleware],
  &#125;,
&#125;),
</code></pre>
<blockquote class="
info "><strong>Hint</strong> Globally registered field middleware functions will be executed <strong>before</strong> locally registered ones (those bound directly to specific fields).
