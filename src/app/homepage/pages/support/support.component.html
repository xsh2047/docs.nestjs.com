<p>Nest is an MIT-licensed open source project with its ongoing development made possible thanks to the support by the community. This framework is a result of the long road, full of sleepless nights, working <strong>after hours</strong>, and busy weekends.</p>
<h4 appAnchor id="how-can-you-help"><span>How can you help?</span></h4>
<p>Nest doesn&#39;t have a large company that sits behind and is continuously paying for hours spent on the development. I fully rely on the <strong>goodness</strong> ❤️ of the people. However, I would love to make this framework even more <strong>powerful</strong>, to be fully focused on delivering you great solutions that make coding process enjoyable: In order to help me, I run few supporting platforms:</p>
<ul>
<li>become a backer or sponsor on <a rel='nofollow' target='_blank' href="https://opencollective.com/nest">OpenCollective</a></li>
<li>use <a rel='nofollow' target='_blank' href="https://paypal.me/kamilmysliwiec">PayPal</a> to send a one-time donation</li>
<li>or reach me directly: <a href="mailto:mail@kamilmysliwiec.com">mail@kamilmysliwiec.com</a></li>
</ul>
<p>If you fell in love with Nest, or you run a business which is using Nest, consider sponsoring its development to ensure that the project which your product relies on is <strong>actively maintained</strong> and improved. Also, your support could help me to work more on content that benefits whole Nest community, writing either educational blog posts or recording videos.</p>
